Analyzing the economic impacts of Vietnam due to malaria and other diseases. 

# Exploring the Economical Impact of Diseases within Vietnam 
By Ricky Le, Khanh Phung, and Phu Quan

## Research Questions
What was the mortality rate during the Malaria epidemic? We want to seek out if the impact of the Malaria disease has decreased the numbers of citizens living in rural areas. 
How did COVID affect Vietnam’s economy? This will help us find out how much of the worldwide pandemic played a factor with Vietnam’s economy and how they responded
What did Vietnam do to decrease the spread of Malaria? We want to see if we can build a machine learning system to predict Vietnam’s economy in the next 5 years based on their past steps.  
Was Vietnam provided any aid to help combat the spread of Malaria? This question explores the alignment between the U.N and how they determine what third-world countries need aid. 

## Motivation

This research is driven by the need to understand the financial and economical impacts that past diseases have played a factor into Vietnam. Having parents immigrated from there, we wanted to do research on how the state of the country was like after they left. And be able to help notice any beneficial or detrimental patterns. Where we can predict the economy in the near future based on these past datasets.

## Data Setting

We plan to use data from the World Health Organization, including multiple different data sets from mortality, malaria, COVID, Tuberculosis, and their sustainable development goals as well. 
 
## Complications and Considerations

- Data Availability: While WHO collects and disseminates vast amounts of health data globally, the availability and granularity of data specific to Vietnam may vary. Some diseases might be better documented or monitored than others, and certain regions within Vietnam might have more robust health surveillance systems than others.

- Data Accuracy and Reliability: It's crucial to ensure that the data obtained from WHO are accurate and reliable. This involves verifying the sources of the data, understanding any potential biases or limitations in the data collection methods, and cross-referencing with other reputable sources where possible.

- Language and Cultural Considerations: Language barriers and cultural differences may pose challenges in interpreting and analyzing the data effectively, especially if the data are primarily available in English and need to be translated into Vietnamese or vice versa. Understanding the local context and nuances is essential for accurate interpretation.

## Method

- Data Visualization Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and usability. This involves filtering for relevant fields, handling missing values, and coding qualifications into quantifiable metrics.
- Statistical Modeling: Apply regression models to assess the impact of application quantity and qualification quality on job market success. This will include controlling for variables like industry and experience level.
- Outcome Evaluation: Compare job market success rates across different applicant profiles to determine the effectiveness of various job application strategies.

## Plan

- Data Acquisition and Cleaning: Task involves downloading the dataset, identifying relevant variables, and cleaning the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: This task is focused on understanding the dataset's basic properties and identifying initial insights.
- Model Development and Visualization: Developing statistical models to answer our research questions, or visualizing it.
Results Interpretation and Report Writing: Compiling our findings into a coherent report.
